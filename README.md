# Android-App
An Android app with a timer and stopwatch.
This app contains various timing and productivity tools. The app has a modular design so that I can keep adding functionality when I get time.

Currently it has three modes: Stopwatch, Pomodoro and Timer

To be implemented:
- Saving total time studied.
- Graphing the times to show differences
