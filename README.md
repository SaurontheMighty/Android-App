# Android-App
An Android app with a timer and stopwatch.
This app contains various timing and productivity tools. The Pomodoro was the first countdown timer I built because it had a set time unlike the Timer which can countdown from any time. This helped me learn how to build a countdown timer for Android and I used this to create a timer which can countdown from any time.
